## 🔄 Featured Project: Complex WordPress Migration & Infrastructure Diagnosis

**The Challenge:** 
A seemingly straightforward WordPress site migration was persistently failing, with the site reverting to a default state after every import attempt, hiding the root cause for weeks.

**The Breakthrough & Solution:** 
- Uncovered the critical difference between **managed hosting (EasyWP)** and **shared hosting (cPanel)**.
- Mastered the use of **All-in-One WP Migration** for full-site transfers.
- Discovered that the Softaculous "Remove" function does not delete core files, requiring a manual overwrite for a truly clean install.
- **Identified the Root Cause:** The domain's DNS was still pointing to the old hosting. The migration on the new server was successful all along; the issue was a fundamental infrastructure misdirection.
- Persisted through multiple diagnostic cycles and engaged professional support with precise technical context to reach the solution.

## 🎯 Latest Breakthrough: DNS Infrastructure Mastery

**The Discovery:** After intensive troubleshooting of a persistent WordPress migration issue, we uncovered the root cause: **DNS was silently pointing to the wrong server.** The migration had been successful all along, but we were testing on the old infrastructure.

**The Resolution:** 
- Executed nameserver update to Stellar hosting:
  - `dns1.namecheaphosting.com`
  - `dns2.namecheaphosting.com`
- Verified new server accessibility via direct IP
- Confirmed security with "403 Forbidden" response
- **Awaiting global DNS propagation** (1-2 hours)

**The Lesson:** 
- **Infrastructure awareness:** Problems can exist outside the application layer
- **Systematic diagnosis:** Essential to check domain → server → application connections
- **Patience in process:** Some solutions require waiting for global systems to sync

> *"The final barrier wasn't technical—it was geographical. The solution existed, waiting for the world to catch up."*

**Status:** Migration complete. Live site imminent post-propagation.

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- Advanced Problem-Solving & Diagnostic Rigor
- Technical Communication & Collaboration
- Web Infrastructure Management (DNS, cPanel, Hosting)
- Persistence in the face of complex, layered challenges

### The Philosophy in Action
> *This project embodies my core belief: **"Disruption always follows intention."** The intention to master this problem created the necessary disruption for profound learning. It also proved that **'all work works, but the work has to work on you long enough before it will work for you.'** *

## 🔄 Featured Project: Complex WordPress Migration & Infrastructure Diagnosis

**The Challenge:** 
A seemingly straightforward WordPress site migration was persistently failing, with the site reverting to a default state after every import attempt, hiding the root cause for weeks.

**The Breakthrough & Solution:** 
- Uncovered the critical difference between **managed hosting (EasyWP)** and **shared hosting (cPanel)**.
- Mastered the use of **All-in-One WP Migration** for full-site transfers.
- Discovered that the Softaculous "Remove" function does not delete core files, requiring a manual overwrite for a truly clean install.
- **Identified the Root Cause:** The domain's DNS was still pointing to the old hosting. The migration on the new server was successful all along; the issue was a fundamental infrastructure misdirection.
- Persisted through multiple diagnostic cycles and engaged professional support with precise technical context to reach the solution.

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- Advanced Problem-Solving & Diagnostic Rigor
- Technical Communication & Collaboration
- Web Infrastructure Management (DNS, cPanel, Hosting)
- Persistence in the face of complex, layered challenges

> *This project embodies my core belief: **"Disruption always follows intention."** The intention to master this problem created the disruption necessary for profound learning.*
